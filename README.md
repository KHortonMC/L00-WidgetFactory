# L00-WidgetFactory
A Group Lab to Say Hello World!

This is a two step lab.

Part 1: Individual Task: extends Widget

We have a widget class that has four abstract methods.
Your task is to create your own class to implement those methods.

Name the class your own name (ex: ProfHorton)
In Factory.java, uncomment the line to add your widget to the array.

There are instructions inside the widget class for what your methods should do.
Once they are complete, your widget's test data should appear after running the project.

When your widget works, commit and pull, then push your project to gothub.
If you have merge errors at this point, please check with the professor for assistance.


Part 2: Team Task: implements a Component

As you complete your widgets, form small groups of collaborators (3 is ideal!)
Check with the professor for which component to complete. 

Choose one work station to collaborate from. When complete, commit and pull, then push to github.
Once your component is complete, peer review with other groups that are complete.


Part 3: We're going to run the whole project as a class.
